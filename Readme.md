# Web Scraping Project

This project uses Scrapy to scrape data from websites. Below are detailed instructions on how to set up, configure, and run the spider.

## Installation

To get started, you need to have Python installed on your system. Then, install Scrapy using pip:

```bash
pip install scrapy
```

---

## Project Setup

To create a new Scrapy project, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
scrapy startproject web_scrapping_spider
```

This will create a new directory called `web_scrapping_spider` with all the necessary files and directories for your project.

---

## Running the Spider

To run the spider, use the following command:
##### incremental_crawling file

```bash
scrapy crawl amd_spider -s JOBDIR=crawls/amd/incremental-spider
```

This command will start the `amd_spider` and save the crawl data incrementally in the specified directory.

---

## Configuration in settings.py

To ensure your spider runs smoothly and adheres to best practices, modify the `settings.py` file as needed:

### User-Agent
Set a custom User-Agent to avoid being blocked by websites:

```python
USER_AGENT = 'your_project_name (+http://www.yourdomain.com)'
```

### Robots.txt
If you want to ignore `robots.txt` rules, configure this setting:

```python
ROBOTSTXT_OBEY = False
```

### Download Delay
To prevent overwhelming the server, set a download delay:

```python
DOWNLOAD_DELAY = 2  # Delay in seconds
```

### Item Pipelines
If you are using item pipelines, enable them by adding the following:

```python
ITEM_PIPELINES = {
    'web_scrapping_spider.pipelines.YourPipeline': 300,
}
```

### Configure Logging
Adjust the logging level to control the verbosity of logs:

```python
LOG_LEVEL = 'INFO'  # Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
```

---

## Further Processing

After running the spider, you can process the scraped data as needed. Here are some common actions:

- **Store in a Database**: Save the data to a database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.
- **Convert to CSV**: Export the data to a CSV file for analysis.
- **Perform Data Analysis**: Use tools like pandas to analyze the scraped data.
