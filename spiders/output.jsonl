See details at https://www.amd.com/en/legal/claims/epyc.html#q=SP5-072 SP5TCO-055: This scenario contains many assumptions and estimates and, while based on AMD internal research and best approximations, should be considered an example for information purposes only, and not used as a basis for decision making over actual testing. The Bare Metal Server Greenhouse Gas Emissions TCO (total cost of ownership) Estimator Tool – v9.37 Pro Refresh, compares the selected AMD EPYC™ and Intel® Xeon® CPU based server solutions required to deliver a TOTAL_PERFORMANCE of 80,000 units of integer performance based on the published scores for these specific Intel Xeon and AMD EPYC CPU based servers as of June 1, 2023. This estimation reflects a 3-year time frame with a PUE of 1.7 and a power US power cost of $0.128 / kWh. This analysis compares a 2P AMD 32 core EPYC 9334 CPU powered server with a SPECrate®2017_int_base a score of 725, https://spec.org/cpu2017/results/res2023q1/cpu2017-20230102-33282.pdf; to a 2P Intel Xeon 16 core Gold_6143 based server with a SPECrate®2017_int_base score of 197, https://spec.org/cpu2017/results/res2017q4/cpu2017-20171114-00863.pdf. Due to the wide variation of costs for real estate or admins, this TCO does not include their costs in this analysis. New AMD powered server OpEx consists of power only. The OpEx for the legacy install base of servers with Intel CPUs consists of power plus the extended warranty costs. Cost to extend the server warranty support is calculated to be 20% annually of the initial purchase price which is calculated using 2023 costs. Using this and the power costs mean that the AMD solution for a 3yr TCO is more than $2.5 million less (62% less) and has a $1.2 million or 93% lower annual OpEx. Environmental impact estimates made leveraging this data, using the Country / Region specific electricity factors from the '2020 Grid Electricity Emissions Factors v1.4 – September 2020', and the United States Environmental Protection Agency 'Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator'.", "type": "HTML"}
